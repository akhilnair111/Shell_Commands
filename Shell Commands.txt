1. To find out where you are in the filesystem, run the command pwd (short for "print working directory"). This prints the absolute path of your current working directory ------ pwd

2. ls lists the contents of your current directory (the one displayed by pwd). If you add the names of some files, ls will list them, and if you add the names of directories, it will list their contents. ------ ls

3. You are in /home/repl. Use ls with a relative path to list the file that has an absolute path of /home/repl/course.txt 
------ ls course.txt

4. You are in /home/repl. Use ls with a relative path to list the file /home/repl/seasonal/summer.csv (Relative paths do not start with a leading '/'.). 
------ ls seasonal/summer.csv

COPY

5.------ cp original.txt duplicate.txt
creates a copy of original.txt called duplicate.txt. If there already was a file called duplicate.txt, it is overwritten. If the last parameter to cp is an existing directory, then a command like:

------ cp seasonal/autumn.csv seasonal/winter.csv backup
copies all of the files into that directory.

6. Make a copy of seasonal/summer.csv in the backup directory (which is also in /home/repl), calling the new file summer.bck
------ cp seasonal/summer.csv backup/summer.bck

7. Copy spring.csv and summer.csv from the seasonal directory into the backup directory without changing your current working directory (/home/repl).
------ cp seasonal/spring.csv seasonal/summer.csv backup

MOVE

8. You are in /home/repl, which has sub-directories seasonal and backup. Using a single command, move spring.csv and summer.csv from seasonal to backup
------ mv seasonal/spring.csv seasonal/summer.csv backup

RENAME

9. mv can also be used to rename files. If you run:

------ mv course.txt old-course.txt
then the file course.txt in the current working directory is "moved" to the file old-course.txt. This is different from the way file browsers work, but is often handy.

One warning: just like cp, mv will overwrite existing files. If, for example, you already have a file called old-course.txt, then the command shown above will replace it with whatever is in course.txt
------ mv winter.csv winter.csv.bck
OUTPUT [autumn.csv  spring.csv  summer.csv  winter.csv.bck]

DELETE

10. ------ rm thesis.txt backup/thesis-2017-08.txt
removes both thesis.txt and backup/thesis-2017-08.txt

11. create and delete directories
If you try to rm a directory, the shell prints an error message telling you it can't do that, primarily to stop you from accidentally deleting an entire directory full of work. Instead, you can use a separate command called rmdir. For added safety, it only works when the directory is empty, so you must delete the files in a directory before you delete the directory. (Experienced users can use the -r option to rm to get the same effect.
------ rm people/agarwal.txt
------ rmdir people
------ mkdir yearly
------ mkdir yearly/2017

12. Move /home/repl/people/agarwal.txt into /tmp/scratch. We suggest you use the ~ shortcut for your home directory and a relative path for the second rather than the absolute path.
------ mv ~/people/agarwal.txt scratch

13. view a file's contents
The simplest way to do this is with cat, which just prints the contents of files onto the screen. (Its name is short for "concatenate", meaning "to link things together", since it will print all the files whose names you give it, one after the other.)
------ cat course.txt

14. view a file's contents piece by piece
less the names of several files, you can type :n (colon and a lower-case 'n') to move to the next file, :p to go back to the previous one, or :q to quit.
------ less seasonal/spring.csv seasonal/summer.csv

15. look at the start of a file
------ head seasonal/summer.csv (default 10 lines)

head will only display the first three lines of the file. If you run head -n 100, it will display the first 100 (assuming there are that many), and so on.
A flag's name usually indicates its purpose (for example, -n is meant to signal "number of lines"). Command flags don't have to be a - followed by a single letter, but it's a widely-used convention.
------ head -n 5 seasonal/winter.csv

16. list everything below a directory
In order to see everything underneath a directory, no matter how deeply nested it is, you can give ls the flag -R (which means "recursive").
------ ls -R
ls has another flag -F that prints a / after the name of every directory and a * after the name of every runnable program. Run ls with the two flags, -R and -F, and the absolute path to your home directory to see everything it contains. 
------ ls -R -F ~

17. select columns from a file
------ cut -f 2-5,8 -d , values.csv
which means "select columns 2 through 5 and columns 8, using comma as the separator". cut uses -f (meaning "fields") to specify columns and -d (meaning "delimiter") to specify the separator. 

18. select lines containing specific values
grep takes a piece of text followed by one or more filenames and prints all of the lines in those files that contain that text. For example, ------ grep bicuspid seasonal/winter.csv prints lines from winter.csv that contain "bicuspid".
some of grep's more common flags:
	-c: print a count of matching lines rather than the lines themselves
	-h: do not print the names of files when searching multiple files
	-i: ignore case (e.g., treat "Regression" and "regression" as matches)
	-l: print the names of files that contain matches, not the matches
	-n: print line numbers for matching lines
	-v: invert the match, i.e., only show lines that don't match
------ grep molar seasonal/autum.csv
------ grep -v -n molar seasonal/spring.csv
------ grep -c incisor seasonal/autumn.csv seasonal/winter.csv
